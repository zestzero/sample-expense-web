This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## More TODOs

- Add github action CI to build, unit test, linting and other verification before merging MRs.
- Add Playwright as UI testing framework and run UI test with github action CI.
- Add `.devcontainer` to make development experience better.
- Optimise bundle splitting to extract vendor and app modules for better load time.
- Add lighthouse to validate performance.
